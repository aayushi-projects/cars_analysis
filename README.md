Exploratory Data Analysis on Car Dataset
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a car dataset to uncover insights into various attributes such as brand, price, fuel type, engine size, and more. The goal is to understand data distribution, detect patterns, and visualize important trends in car features and pricing.

Objectives
Clean and preprocess the car dataset

Perform statistical analysis and visualization

Identify correlations between features

Understand factors affecting car prices

Step-by-Step Process
1. Data Loading
The dataset is imported using pandas from a CSV file

Basic information (.info(), .describe()) is retrieved to understand the shape and structure

2. Data Cleaning
Missing values are identified and handled

Duplicate entries are removed

Irrelevant or redundant columns (if any) are dropped

3. Feature Engineering
New features (e.g., price per cc, log price) are derived for better visualization

Categorical columns are encoded or grouped where necessary

4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Univariate Analysis: Histograms and boxplots for features like price, engine size, and mileage

Bivariate Analysis: Scatter plots, bar plots, and pair plots to explore relationships between features

Correlation Analysis: Heatmap is used to identify strongly correlated variables

5. Visualization
Matplotlib and Seaborn are used for creating:

Count plots for categorical features (e.g., fuel type, brand)

Boxplots to observe price distributions across categories

Heatmaps and scatter plots to show correlation and trends

6. Insights
Top car brands by frequency

Price variations by fuel type and body type

How engine size and mileage influence car price

Requirements
Python 3.x

Libraries:

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

seaborn

Output
Cleaned and preprocessed car dataset

Visual insights about pricing, brand popularity, and feature relationships

Correlation matrix and feature distribution plots
